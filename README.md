reddit-associated-links
=======================

A tool to help find the source of a gif

What it does is it will ask Reddit if the link has been posted before, then it searches through the comments of every post looking for links.  It then aggregates all the links together and shows you the list, reverse sorted by combined points.  Lots of times, you will see a link near the top entitled "source".

installation
============
This code is set up as a "bookmarklet", which means all you need to do is create a bookmark and set the destination of the bookmark to the script.  You're done!

usage
=====
There's two ways to use this tool.

1: Highlight the link you wish to search for, then click the bookmarklet.
2: Click the bookmarklet, checkboxes will appear beside each post.  Check the one you wish to search for and run the bookmarklet again.

Here is an example of it running on Firefox for Android using above method #2
